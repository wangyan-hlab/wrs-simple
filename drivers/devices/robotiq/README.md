* Quick Notes
  * This package provides an interface to access the old robotiq ft300 sensors and 85 grippers.
  * For the e-series hands, it does not work. Instead of developing a driver, I am uploading a whole robotiq script from urcaps for the e-series.
  * TODO: This package may also be replaced by uploading a whole robotiq script from urcaps.
